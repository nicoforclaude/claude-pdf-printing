# PDF Printing: Print Documents

## Current implementation

**TEST MODE** - This is a placeholder command to test the plugin system.

Your task: Confirm that the `/pdf-printing:print` command is working.

Tell the user:
"✓ PDF Printing plugin is installed and working!

This is a test command. Implementation coming soon.

When implemented, this command will:
- Scan for markdown files in the project
- Present interactive selection interface
- Apply date range filtering (e.g., last 7 days)
- Generate PDFs from selected files
- Open the output directory

Status: Plugin system test successful!"

What you ask:
* File choice (interactive ...)
* Print mode (PDF)
